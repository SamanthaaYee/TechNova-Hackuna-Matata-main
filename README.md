## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

connectivIT is a website that facilitates donations between those in need of technology and those with devices they no longer use, with a specific focus on low-income rural communities and Indigenous reserves.

Donors and receivers start by submitting forms on the website indicating which items they are donating or requesting. Once submitted, donations and requests are matched to best suit the requests. The tech is picked up from the donorâ€™s location, and brought to a centre for quality control, data removal, and sanitization. Finally, the products will be brought to those who requested the technology.

**Home Page:** If users have any questions, they may refer to the FAQ section or send a message in our Contact Us section.

**About Page:** Our website provides a summary on why we started the initiative and the entire process of our operation.

**Forms:** Donors can indicate which device they would like to donate when filling out the donation form. Similarly, those requesting technology can choose up to 3 devices in the request form. There is also a volunteer form that can be filled out if someone is interested in helping with the initiative.

**Backend:** The information received from the user form submissions is saved and can be used to match clients donations and requests.
